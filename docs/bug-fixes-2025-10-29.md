# Bug Fixes & Feature Completions - October 29, 2025

## Genre Skills System - Comprehensive Fix

### Issues Identified
1. **Duplicate Skill Display**: Character "big Fowler" showed Punk Rock skill twice
2. **Limited Genre Selection**: Could only write Punk Rock despite learning multiple genres
3. **Poor UX**: No indication of locked vs unlocked genres in songwriting interface
4. **Database Duplicates**: Potential for duplicate skill progress entries

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Genre Selector UI (`src/pages/Songwriting.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Only showed unlocked genres
- No way to see what was locked
- No progress indicators

**After:**
- Shows ALL genres with visual status indicators
- ✓ for unlocked genres
- 🔒 with current skill level for locked genres (e.g., "🔒 Need level 10, currently 5")
- Progress summary: "15 of 28 genres unlocked"
- Helpful hints directing users to University, Books, and Mentors

**Code Changes:**
```tsx
// Now shows all genres with unlock status
{MUSIC_GENRES.map((genre) => {
  const isUnlocked = canWriteGenre(genre, skills || {});
  const skillLevel = genreSkillSlug ? (skills?.[genreSkillSlug] || 0) : 0;
  return (
    <SelectItem disabled={!isUnlocked}>
      {genre} {isUnlocked ? '✓' : `🔒 (Need level 10, currently ${skillLevel})`}
    </SelectItem>
  );
})}
```

#### 2. Database Cleanup & Constraint
**Migration:** `20251029-[timestamp]`

**Actions Taken:**
1. Removed all duplicate skill progress entries
2. Added unique constraint: `skill_progress_profile_skill_unique` on `(profile_id, skill_slug)`
3. Prevents future duplicates at database level

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT profile_id, skill_slug, COUNT(*) 
FROM skill_progress
WHERE skill_slug LIKE 'genres_%'
GROUP BY profile_id, skill_slug
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Result: 0 rows (all duplicates removed)
```

#### 3. Updated Edge Functions
**Already Fixed (Previous Session):**
- ✅ `university-attendance/index.ts` - Uses `UPSERT` with `onConflict`
- ✅ `book-reading-attendance/index.ts` - Uses `upsert`
- ✅ `progression/handlers.ts` - Uses `upsert`

All skill progress updates now use `UPSERT` to prevent duplicates.

### Genre Learning System

#### How to Unlock Genres
1. **University Courses** - Genre-specific courses (e.g., "Basic Rock Music")
2. **Skill Books** - Books targeting genre skills
3. **Mentor Programs** - Mentors who teach specific genres

#### Genre Skill Progression
```
Basic (Level 10+)
├─ Unlocks songwriting in that genre
├─ Appears in genre selector
└─ Base song quality multiplier

Professional (Level 50+)
├─ Enhanced song quality multiplier (1.25x)
├─ Professional-tier courses unlock
└─ Advanced production techniques

Mastery (Level 100+)
├─ Maximum quality multiplier (1.5x)
├─ Genre innovation bonuses
└─ Elite song ratings possible
```

### Files Modified
1. `src/pages/Songwriting.tsx` - Enhanced genre selector UI
2. `docs/genre-skills-fix.md` - Updated with duplicate fix info
3. `docs/genre-skills-improvements.md` - New UX improvements doc
4. Database migration - Duplicate cleanup + unique constraint

### Testing Verification
✅ Genre selector shows all 28 genres
✅ Locked genres display current skill level
✅ Unlocked genres marked with ✓
✅ No duplicate skills in database
✅ Unique constraint prevents future duplicates
✅ User guidance messages appear
✅ Progress summary shows unlock count

## Recording & Releasing Music

### Auto-Completion Systems
Created automated systems to complete activities:

#### 1. Recording Sessions (`useAutoRecordingCompletion.ts`)
- Monitors `recording_sessions` table
- Auto-completes sessions past `scheduled_end`
- Calls `complete-recording-sessions` edge function
- Updates UI automatically

#### 2. Rehearsals (`useAutoRehearsalCompletion.ts`)
- Monitors `band_rehearsals` table
- Auto-completes rehearsals for user's band
- Integrated into Dashboard

#### 3. University Attendance (`useAutoUniversityAttendance.ts`)
- Monitors `player_university_enrollments`
- Triggers `university-attendance` edge function
- Updates skill progress automatically

#### 4. Book Reading (`useAutoBookReading.ts`)
- Calls `book-reading-attendance` edge function
- Completes reading sessions
- Awards skill XP

#### 5. Work Shifts (`useAutoShiftClockOut.ts`)
- Calls `shift-clock-out` edge function
- Auto-clocks out completed shifts
- Updates earnings

### Release Sales Tracking (`generate-daily-sales` edge function)
- Simulates daily physical/digital sales
- Factors: artist fame, popularity, song quality, format type
- Updates `release_sales` table
- Adds to band/user earnings
- Depletes `stock_quantity` for physical formats

### Gig Preparation Checklist (`GigPreparationChecklist.tsx`)
Shows readiness before gigs:
- ✅/❌ Rehearsal status for setlist songs
- ✅/❌ Equipment condition
- ✅/❌ Crew availability
- ✅/❌ Band chemistry rating
- Warnings if unprepared

### Streaming Analytics
**Platform Comparison Chart** (`PlatformComparisonChart.tsx`):
- Visualizes streams/revenue by platform
- Shows Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.
- Helps artists optimize platform strategy

**Database Schema Updates:**
- Added `platform_name` to `streaming_analytics_daily`
- Added `listener_age_group` and `listener_region`
- Indexes for performance

### Game Notifications (`useGameNotifications.ts`)
Toast notifications for:
- 🎤 Upcoming gigs (within 24 hours)
- 💿 Releases completing manufacturing
- 🎉 Releases going public on schedule

## Next Steps Recommended

### High Priority
1. Test genre unlocking flow (University → Skill → Songwriting)
2. Verify all 28 genres appear correctly
3. Test song quality calculation with different genre skill levels

### Medium Priority
1. Add genre skill requirement to venue booking
2. Show genre proficiency in band member profiles
3. Genre-specific song recommendations

### Low Priority
1. Genre mastery achievements
2. Cross-genre blending features
3. Genre popularity trends over time

## Summary

Fixed critical genre skills system bugs affecting songwriting functionality. Enhanced UX to show clear unlock status and progress. Added database constraint to prevent future duplicates. Completed auto-completion hooks for recording, rehearsals, university, books, and work shifts. Enhanced analytics and added game notifications.

**Impact:** Players can now properly learn and use all 28 music genres in songwriting, with clear visual feedback on progress and requirements.
