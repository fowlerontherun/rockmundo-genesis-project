# Genre Skills System - Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Genre Selector UI Enhancement
**Problem**: The songwriting genre selector only showed unlocked genres without indicating which ones were locked or progress toward unlocking them.

**Solution**: Enhanced the genre selector to show:
- All genres (not just unlocked ones)
- Visual indicators (âœ“ for unlocked, ðŸ”’ for locked)
- Current skill level vs required level for locked genres
- Summary message showing unlock progress (e.g., "15 of 28 genres unlocked")
- Helpful hint to learn genres through University, Books, or Mentors

### 2. Duplicate Skill Progress Prevention
**Problem**: Although the university-attendance function was fixed to use `UPSERT`, there could have been existing duplicates in the database.

**Solution**: Cleaned up any duplicate skill progress entries by keeping only the most recent entry per (profile_id, skill_slug) combination.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users could only see unlocked genres in dropdown
- No indication of what's locked or how to unlock
- Confusing when character has learned genres but can't see them

### After
- All genres visible with clear lock/unlock status
- Shows current skill level vs required level (10)
- Guides users to learning resources
- Shows overall progress (e.g., "15 of 28 genres unlocked")

## Technical Details
