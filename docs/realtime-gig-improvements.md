**Component**: `src/components/band/GigHistoryTab.tsx`

### 3. Simplified Navigation
**Changes**:
- Shortened navigation section titles (removed verbose emoji descriptions)
- Consolidated similar menu items
- Removed redundant items (e.g., "Stage Setup", "Underworld")
- Cleaner, more focused navigation structure

## Technical Implementation

### Gig Status Display
- Scheduled gigs show status badge only (no button)

### Real-time Processing
- Songs are processed automatically based on their duration
- Each song gets individual performance calculations
- System advances to next song automatically
- Gig completes when all songs are finished

### History Storage
- All completed gigs are stored in `gig_outcomes` table
- Linked to individual song performances
- Includes detailed metrics (attendance, revenue, profit, fame)
- Accessible via new "Gig History" tab
